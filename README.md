# Understanding the Impact of Correlation within Pair-Bonds on Cormack-Jolly-Seber Models

The `R` code used to conduct and analyze the simulation study from our article "Understanding the Impact of Correlation within Pair-Bonds on Cormack-Jolly-Seber Models" is available here. 

There are two folders called `scripts` (contains all of the `R` code used in work) and output (contains results of the study done in the article). 

Details about our methods and approach can be found in the article which is available at the link below.
